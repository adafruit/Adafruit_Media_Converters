# media2array
Python 3 scripts for converting bitmaps, images and WAVs to Arduino PROGMEM arrays.

Remember to install PIL with `pip3 install pillow`

- Bitmap images for Adafruit_GFX drawBitmap() function.
- Image to NeoPixel data for animation.
- WAV to 8- or 10-bit DAC data. This is a WIP and may adopt a different N-bit packing strategy.
